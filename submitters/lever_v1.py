# (jobs.lever.co/collate, capture.json committed alongside this change)
# proved never exists on a real page: every v2 inspection would SELECTOR_DRIFT
# before a real form was ever read. v3 is a genuinely different, evidence-
# backed contract, not a patch -- bumping the version is what keeps any old
# fixture-qualified evidence for v2 from silently vouching for v3's behavior.
#
# v4 (same day): v3's label extraction took the whole <label> element's
# text, which on real markup pulls in sibling .application-field UI chrome
# (upload-progress status text, autocomplete "Loading"/"No results" text)
# for any field whose control has rich nested state -- silently breaking
# label-text matching (resume attachment recognition returned False on the
# real resume field; the location field's label could never satisfy any
# alias check) without ever surfacing as SELECTOR_DRIFT. v4 reads
# .application-label specifically, confirmed 1:1 present across every field
# in the real fixture. This changes observe_lever_v1_fields's output for the
# same real HTML, which is exactly what selector_version exists to track --
# lever_v1_form_fingerprint hashes it into every fingerprint, and v3
# fingerprints must not be treated as equivalent to v4 ones.
# v5 (same day, found migrating the fixture backlog to real markup):
# _visible() checked display:none/visibility:hidden/opacity:0 but not
# content-visibility:hidden, a standard CSS property that also fully hides
# an element -- inconsistent with _static_actionability_capture, which
# already recognizes content-visibility:hidden as a hiding technique for
# actionability purposes just a few lines below. A real page (or an
# injected wrapper) hiding a form this way would have been read as visible.
# Not evidence-dependent -- a plain CSS-semantics fix, not a claim about
# what real Lever markup looks like -- but still changes _exact_form's
# (and therefore observe_lever_v1_fields's and assess_lever_v1_snapshot's)
# output for the same HTML, so the version bumps regardless.

#   direct measurement, not assumption. "urls_Other_"'s real label is
#   literally the employer's own name ("Collate"), not a stable phrase at
#   all, so it could never have a real alias regardless.
# - "resume": FieldType.FILE fields never reach this alias-compatibility
#   check in the first place (form_planning.py gates automatic_resolution_
