# Job Apply Agent

A private, local-first assistant for discovering jobs, routing a CV, preparing
application materials, reviewing observed ATS forms, and recording
evidence-verified outcomes.

## Current verified status

The system is **not a universal or unattended auto-applier**.

- Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, and SmartRecruiters are
  `fixture_qualified` only.
- The committed evidence contains exactly 87 sanitized fixtures:
  Workday 9, Greenhouse 22, Lever 28, Ashby 13, and SmartRecruiters 15.
- Real-URL dry runs completed: 0.
- Live canaries completed: 0.
- Qualified form fingerprints/scopes: 0.
- Enabled final executors: 0.
- No NVIDIA, employer-tenant, or real-submission qualification is claimed.

The generated [qualification matrix](docs/qualification/adapter-matrix.md)
binds these numbers to the central registry and five report pairs.

Discovery and preparation can run continuously. Final **Send application**
remains an explicit operator action for one exact reviewed application or
reviewed batch. With the current qualification evidence, the final-action gate
stays closed.

The signed qualified-autopilot authority is implemented but cannot be
activated with the checked-in fixture-only qualification evidence. Activation
requires at least one exact live-canary-qualified semantic form contract.
The guarded dry-run and one-use canary framework is implemented, but no live
qualification was performed as part of that implementation.

## Submission truth

Preparing, queueing, clicking, redirecting, receiving HTTP 2xx, finding a
generic success phrase, or expecting an email never makes an application green.

Green requires employer-side evidence tied to the exact attempt, reviewed form
fingerprint, and verified CV attachment. A possible external action without
that proof becomes `unknown`, moves to review, and cannot retry automatically.

Attempt stages are:

`queued → inspecting → preparing → ready → committing → verifying → finished`

Terminal outcomes include `confirmed_submitted`, `already_applied`,
`needs_review`, `unknown`, `failed_before_commit`, `draft_only`,
`operator_confirmed`, and `legacy_unverified`. Operator reconciliation is
useful audit information but is not employer-verified green.

## Privacy and safety boundary

The private Windows runner keeps:

- `user_profile.yaml`, `cv_routing.yaml`, and every CV;
- confirmed answers, generated materials, and form plans;
- browser profiles, cookies, and employer sessions;
- Chromium and the browser worker;
- local Ollama prompts and outputs.

An optional Vercel control plane stores only redacted coordination metadata:
opaque application/grant/command references, adapter/outcome codes, timestamps,
and evidence digests.

The project does not:

- extract Chrome or Edge passwords;
- accept credentials through chat;
- solve CAPTCHA or bypass MFA/security challenges;
- use stealth escalation, proxy rotation, or automatic retry after ambiguity;
- send private application content to Vercel;
- use an automatic cloud-LLM fallback in production;
- treat a previous employer application as proof of a new submission.

## Architecture

The five bounded contexts are:

1. **Job Discovery** — ingest and deduplicate public job metadata.
2. **Application Preparation** — score, route a CV, generate bounded material,
   and abstain on unsupported facts.
3. **Submission Execution** — create a durable attempt, one-use permit, and
   database-backed command.
4. **ATS Integration** — inspect through one exact versioned candidate-browser
   adapter; authorized API transports remain separate and disabled.
5. **Evidence/Reconciliation** — verify employer evidence or retain a
   non-retryable unknown outcome.

Redis/Celery may wake work, but PostgreSQL is authoritative. The irreversible
boundary is persisted before the final action. A worker crash after that
boundary can never create an automatic duplicate.

## Local model

Production preparation uses local Ollama `qwen2.5:7b`, one inference at a time,
with schema validation, bounded timeouts, a circuit breaker, and no cloud
fallback:

```powershell
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
ollama serve
```

Answer resolution is deterministic facts first, then exact user-confirmed
evidence, approved reusable facts, structured CV evidence, and local-LLM
synthesis for non-sensitive questions. Authorization, sponsorship,
citizenship, nationality, clearance, licensing, certifications, demographics,
consent, and attestations require confirmed evidence. No LLM runs during the
final external-action stage.

## Quick start in safe mode

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.11 or 3.13;
- PowerShell 7.2 or newer (`pwsh`) for the managed Windows runtime;
- Docker Desktop for the managed Windows runtime;
- local Ollama with `qwen2.5:7b`;
- Redis for asynchronous workers;
- PostgreSQL for production and concurrency guarantees;
- Chromium/Playwright only for explicit browser inspection.

Install:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,browser]"
playwright install chromium
copy .env.example .env
copy user_profile.yaml.example user_profile.yaml
copy cv_routing.yaml.example cv_routing.yaml
```

Keep the safe values:

```dotenv
APP_ENV=development
DRY_RUN=true
DRAFT_ONLY=true
AUTO_APPLY=false
PORTAL_FINAL_SUBMIT_ENABLED=false
LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
LLM_MODEL=qwen2.5:7b
OLLAMA_NO_CLOUD=true
```

Run the API:

```powershell
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --port 8000
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. The effective-mode banner and readiness checks
must agree before preparation. A green liveness check does not mean submission
is available.

Complete the local **Candidate Profile → Complete private onboarding** form
before preparation or submission. Placeholder identity does not block
discovery, but confirmed identity and legal facts remain mandatory for later
stages. `AUTO_APPLY` is a deprecated auto-preparation alias and never enables
qualified autopilot.

For asynchronous preparation, start a worker and Beat only after Redis and the
database are ready:

```powershell
python -m celery -A worker.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
python -m celery -A worker.celery_app beat --loglevel=info
```

## Private profile and CV routing

Edit the ignored `user_profile.yaml`, `cv_routing.yaml`, and `cvs/` directory.
Only sanitized `.example` templates belong in Git.

Routing uses title, description, seniority, required skills, and ordered
overrides. It returns a selected CV, confidence, evidence, and fallback reason.
Low confidence, malformed output, unreadable CVs, and non-finite confidence
fail closed for review. The selected CV identifier/hash and profile version are
bound through preparation, form planning, attachment, attempt, and evidence.

## Browser sessions

Use isolated persistent profiles; never point the project at an active
Chrome/Edge profile:

```powershell
python -m scripts.portal_session_bootstrap "https://employer.example/job/..."
```

Complete sign-in and MFA manually. Session readiness does not qualify the form.
The example environment derives LinkedIn and employer profile paths from
`JOB_AGENT_BROWSER_STATE_DIR`, so host sign-in commands and Compose workers use
the same isolated browser state.
Every inspection creates an expiring immutable plan. Any form, selector,
application, CV, profile, session, or build change invalidates its authority.

## WhatsApp and LinkedIn ingestion

The WhatsApp bridge is a local adapter to the local API. When the API is running
on this PC, set `bridge/.env` to `JOB_AGENT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000`; a Vercel
URL is a redacted control plane and cannot run the private worker, browser, or
Ollama pipeline. Set `JOB_AGENT_TOKEN` to the local API secret, then enable only
the sources you intend to use:

```dotenv
JOB_AGENT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
JOB_AGENT_TOKEN=<the-local-SECRET_KEY>
ALLOW_NONLOCAL_AGENT_URL=false
FORWARD_TEXT_POSTS=true
FORWARD_DIRECT_MESSAGES=true
DIRECT_CHAT_NUMBERS=9725XXXXXXXX
```

Install and run the bridge from the repository (after the local API is ready):

```powershell
cd bridge
npm ci
copy .env.example .env
npm start
```

On the first run, scan the QR code shown in the terminal. The session is stored
under the ignored `bridge/.wwebjs_auth/` directory; no WhatsApp password is
read or stored by this project.

`DIRECT_CHAT_NUMBERS` is an explicit digits-only allowlist; direct chats remain
ignored when it is empty. Group filtering is controlled independently by
`WATCH_ALL_GROUPS`, `WATCH_ARCHIVED_ONLY`, and `GROUP_KEYWORDS`. Set
`WATCH_ARCHIVED_ONLY=true` when job posts are kept in archived groups; the
keyword filter still applies unless `WATCH_ALL_GROUPS=true`. The bridge uses a
known-good WhatsApp Web snapshot by default. If WhatsApp changes its internal
protocol, pin only a tested `WA_WEB_VERSION` together with its matching
`WA_WEB_VERSION_REMOTE_PATH`; do not switch to an unqualified live snapshot.
The bridge forwards job metadata and
text to `/api/ingest` or `/api/ingest-text`; it does not submit applications or
send messages unless the separate, disabled outbound-send flag is intentionally
enabled. A longer `AGENT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` prevents slow local extraction from
being reported as a forwarding failure, but it never retries an external action.
Set `ARCHIVE_SCAN_ON_START=true` (with a bounded `ARCHIVE_SCAN_LIMIT`) to scan
recent messages from eligible archived groups once at startup; link bodies are
processed in memory and only deduplicated job-link records are sent to the
loopback API. WhatsApp can hydrate archived chat windows shortly after the
session reports ready, so the bridge also performs two bounded cache rescans by
default (`ARCHIVE_RESCAN_DELAY_MS=30000`, `ARCHIVE_RESCAN_ATTEMPTS=2`). These
rescans never request unbounded history or persist unrelated message text. With
the optional `FORWARD_TEXT_POSTS` flag enabled, only keyword-matching, no-URL
job posts are forwarded to the loopback API; otherwise only deduplicated job
links leave the bridge process. A
cache-only rescan repeats every ten minutes by default
(`ARCHIVE_RESCAN_INTERVAL_MS=600000`) so messages hydrated later are picked up
without restarting the bridge; set the interval to `0` to disable periodic
polling. Intervals below 60 seconds or malformed values fail closed (periodic
polling is disabled), and an older explicit `ARCHIVE_RESCAN_ATTEMPTS=0` with no
interval preserves startup-only behavior. Periodic passes read only already
hydrated cache windows; they never invoke historical pagination. Historical
messages that WhatsApp has not hydrated remain unavailable to this read-only
integration.

For LinkedIn, do not enable scheduled crawling. Use the dedicated Gmail job-alert
label (local read-only OAuth) or an approved partner feed. For an exact LinkedIn
URL, create an isolated persistent profile and sign in manually:

```powershell
python -m discovery.login
```

Set `LINKEDIN_BROWSER_PROFILE_DIR` to that profile directory. Login, MFA, and
CAPTCHA are operator steps; a missing/expired session is recorded as
`LINKEDIN_SESSION_REQUIRED` and the job remains reviewable rather than being
silently treated as discovered or submitted.

## Main operator interfaces

The local Windows API leaves `GET /health/live`, `GET /health/ready`, and
`GET /metrics` unauthenticated so local process and container probes can use
them. Bind them to loopback or an internal network; do not publish them through
Vercel or an internet-facing proxy. Detailed application and operational API
routes require bearer authentication outside the explicit development-only,
prepare-only placeholder-auth bypass.

| GET | `/api/runtime/capabilities` | Build, mode, runner, LLM, and send guards |
| GET | `/api/ats/adapters` | Version and qualification inventory |

| POST | `/api/automation/policy/activate` | Activate one local, signed, max-30-day policy revision |
| POST | `/api/automation/policy/revoke` | Revoke the current local policy immediately |
| POST | `/api/automation/kill-switch` | Activate or locally clear the emergency stop |
| GET | `/api/automation/status` | Readiness plus effective qualified-autopilot state |
| POST | `/api/applications/{id}/prepare` | Review/prepare; queues no external action |
| POST | `/api/applications/{id}/inspect` | Build a private form plan |
| POST | `/api/applications/{id}/qualification/dry-run` | Guarded explicit real-URL inspection; final action disabled |
| POST | `/api/applications/{id}/qualification/canary` | One-use exact canary request after dry-run review |
| GET | `/api/applications/{id}/form-plan` | Read latest plan and blockers |
| POST | `/api/applications/{id}/answers/{field_id}/confirm` | Confirm one exact answer or explicitly review a safe optional field as blank (`confirm_blank=true`) |
| POST | `/api/applications/{id}/submit` | Request exact explicit send; normally disabled now |
| GET | `/api/submission-attempts/{id}` | Poll the authoritative attempt |
| POST | `/api/submission-attempts/{id}/reconcile` | Reconcile an unknown attempt |
| POST | `/api/applications/{id}/retry` | Re-prepare only definitive pre-commit/draft outcomes |

The deprecated `/approve` route is a preparation alias and never claims
submission.

## Vercel control plane

Vercel cannot run Chromium, Ollama, or the authoritative private application
workflow. It may host a protected redacted control plane whose one-use commands
are signed and accepted only by the private runner.

This is a separate HTTP boundary: the isolated Vercel control plane exposes
only `/health/live` without an operator session. Its readiness, grant, command,
dashboard, and runner-management routes remain protected.

Start with the [control-plane bootstrap](docs/control-plane-bootstrap.md).
Preview deployments cannot dispatch. A restored control plane deactivates all
old devices and requires new identities before reconnecting.

The protected control plane can send a separately signed, five-minute,
activation-only emergency-stop command. It cannot clear the stop or create
autopilot authority; clearing remains a local authenticated action.

The private runner sends a signed redacted operations heartbeat every ten
seconds. The Vercel view shows only bounded counters, fixed source/adapter
codes, policy state, release identity, timestamps, and evidence digests. The
full role/CV, fit, application, and attempt views remain local.
